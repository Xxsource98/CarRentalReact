# About
It is my first "big" site in React JS. I made that because I was bored, but I'm very satisfied of that so I uploaded it there. I made there filtering elements system and shopping cart with LocalStorage method. Every image on the site is mentioned by hovering on it, or on select car. Icons are made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com, what is mentioned in "About us" section.

## Building the app
For build the app, firstly download project with `git clone https://github.com/Xxsource98/CarRentalReact`. Later open terminal in your directory and use command `npm i` which will install all necessary modules. If everything will successfully download, just start application with `npm start`
